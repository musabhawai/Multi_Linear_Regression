# Multi_Linear_Regression

## üìå Overview
This repository contains multiple small projects that demonstrate the use of *Multiple Linear Regression* for different prediction problems:
1. *Predicting Home Price* ‚Äì Using multiple features such as area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
2. *Predicting Salary* ‚Äì Based on factors like years of experience and test scores.
3. *Predicting Home Price with Dummy Variables* ‚Äì Incorporating categorical features such as city.
4. *Predicting Car Price with Dummy Variables* ‚Äì Considering categorical factors like car model and mileage.

## üìñ About Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of *Linear Regression* that uses *two or more independent variables* to predict a continuous target variable.  
The model fits a linear equation of the form:

\[
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted value  
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are input features  
- \( b_0 \) is the intercept  
- \( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) are coefficients  

This method helps capture the combined effect of multiple predictors on the target variable.
